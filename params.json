This lets you run your games directly from github!\r\nCheck it out: http://gmu-cs325.github.io/digital-template/\r\nFork this repository, checkout the `gh-pages` branch, and start making your own game!\r\n\r\nYou can't run the `index.html` directly from your local machine without a local webserver.\r\nIf you try, the images won't load (your browser will prevent it, thinking it is malicious).\r\nTo get around this, use python (enter the directory and type `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)\r\nor install [`node.js`](http://nodejs.org/) and the `http-server` package,\r\nand then type `http-server` from inside the directory.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
